## The Ultimate Horace Heracy Reading Order

### Preface

The Horus Heresy is an amazing series. For readers who can get their teeth into the setting and themes there's near 1000 hours of worthwhile content. But how are you supposed to approach something nearly 70 full length novels in length where the release order is neither coherent or spoiler-free? The variable quality of entries presents a problem of its own. How do you make your way through such a maelstrom of content? Fear not. Here's an opinionated guide from someone who's read the entire series multiple times. Thank god I got that English lit degree.

This document will attempt to distil the entire literary universe into a series of core  of the books and present them in a chronollogically correct and spoiler-free reading order. If you follow this list you'll have a near comprehensive knowledge of all the major plot points in the setting, while not having to push through the misses, lesser novels, anthologies, supplementary works of the series. 

For the benefit of those who find themselves bored by particular events and factions I've split my recommendations into the contiguous storylines that I feel make up the series. If you have strong preferences on what and what not to read you can skip entire storylines, but it's probably a bad idea to read the storylines themselves out of order or skip novels within them. There are major novels that won't fit into the storyline structure, as well as all of the anthologies.

If you're about to undertake this journey, good luck. I hope you enjoy this one of a kind series as much as I do.

### 1 - The Isstvan III Betrayal Storyline

1 - Horus Rising - Dan Abnett - Book 1

It's a great introduction to the setting. The vast majority of characters both Human and Astartesian are characterful and engaging, Abnett's has a wonderful ability to write in a way that evokes imagery without stuffing his prose full of irrelevent descriptors. Full of foreboding but never detatched from the present - I really like Horus Rising and most people do. 8/10. Essential reading. 

2 - False Gods - Graham McNeill - Book 2

False Gods is essential reading and also an engaging book. I'm struggling to describe this one because for all of the memorable and gripping moments it subjects the reader to there's also an aspect of boredom and I get the feeling that McNeill really connected with some of these plot points but not all of them. I have read it three times, but it's not objectively excellent. 6/10

3 - Galaxy in Flames - Ben Counter - Book 3

The first half of Galaxy in Flames is something of a mess. There are a _lot_ of characters. They're essential to the plot, but they make the book hard to follow and easy to glaze over. Fatigue set in for me on the first two reads as I struggled to keep up with the cast and come to terms with a relatively rapid change in tone amongst the Luna Wolves. I'm not sure how hard the ending hits on first read, my partner says it hits pretty hard. But jesus when you're invested it hits hard. It's an epic and well fleshed out conlcusion to the first three books that has profound implications for the rest. It's a genuine nail-biter. It gets me going. Goosebumps. Shadow boxing. You name it. Whether it hits that hard for you or not you can't really avoid it, it's plot essential, and I really do think the exceptionally strong conclusion drags it into the territory of another 8/10

4 - The Flight of the Eisenstein - James Swallow - Book 4

The Flight of the Eisenstein is a solid book. Honestly, the warsinger plot is a stupid concession to Warhammer 40k's background in the 80s. Grulgor is a bore of a character. Garro takes on immense character over the course of the series, but doesn't necesasrily have that character as you see him in this book. It's very effectively salvaged by the injection of Keeler, Sindermann, Oliton, and Qruze into the plot though. In fact, the second half of the book in general is pretty engaging. First real warp sequence of the series. Also concludes in a manner that's genuinely exciting and perfectly timed in the context of the novels around it. It touches on some really interesting themology towards the end as well. 7/10.

### 2 - The Isstvan V Dropsite Massacre Storyline

5 - Fulgrim - Graham McNeill - Book 5

Guady, camp, jolly, and eventually horrifying - this novel is one of the best in the series if you can forgive McNeill taking a regency melodrama apporach to human relations. Combining the influence of _she who thirsts_ with the human, astarte, and primarch inhabitants of The Pride of the Emperor with the naturally flamboyant, excessive, and dramatic nature of the Emperor's Children is a brilliant demonstration of the insidious influence of the warp on the minds of men. McNeill loves his rememberencers, and you can feel it. Fabius is a delightful villain. It's a real shame that we don't see more of Ferrus Manus, who comes across adorably in this depiction. There's a lot to like. Unfortunately, a large portion of the beginning of the novel is consumed by horrifically boring combat sequences, and sometimes Fulgrim comes across as 2-dimensional unengaging. Still, if you like a psychodrama it's an 8/10.

### 3 - Legion (Single Novel)

6 - Legion (Book 7) 

Here's our first example of reading the books in a different order than they were published. Immediately following Book 5, Fulgrim, in the release order was Book 6, Descent of Angels. The Dark Angels storyline genuinely bores me to tears. I hate their legion character and I have no interest in their history or how they're written. Most people I've spoken to strongly concur. We'll be skipping all novels in their storyline.

Legion on the other hand, is a good and interesting book that introduces the (mostly) genetically standard human military forces of the empire as well as various xenos species, an interesting space marine legion, and a very important main character.

### 4 - The Schism of Mars Storyline

6 - Mechanicum (Book 9)

Book 8, Battle for the Abyss, is ok. I found it kind of filler-y and I don't think it plays an important role in the plot. It's technically the first book in an important plotline later on, but even that plotline kind of disowns it and replaces it with more important and better books covering its prelude later on. 

The 6 books you've read so far have given a nice introduction to many of the most important factions in the universe but mostly neglected one of the most important. Considered a separate but equal organ from the empire's inception, the Mechanicum have titular control over most of the empire's manufactory hubs and pieces of high-technology. They're a key player often overlooked in the conflict and I think Mechanicum does a mostly good job of introducing and motivating them. 

I would have liked to have seen more Mechanicum in the series and I feel this book undersells them a little but it's an important and entertaining read and provides the cliffnotes early on.

### 5 - The Shadow Crusade Storyline

We're skipping Book 10 (Tales of Heresy - an anthology), Book 11 (Fallen Angels), Book 12 (A Thousand Sons) and Book 13 (Nemesis). We'll come back to the last two, but for now we'll move onto

7 - The First Heretic (Book 14)

Emperor forgive me, but I think the Horus Heresy itself is best understood when one has empathy for the insurgents and a grasp of the context in which they behave. The First Heretic charts the experiences of the word-bearers within the pre-heresy empire and explores their interactions with chaos. It's an essential read not only for an understanding of the forces of chaos and what drives man to embrace the warp, but also for the sake of the entire Shadow Crusade storyline which it preludes.

For the sake of keeping the Shadow Crusade storyline intact we are going to skip Books 15 (Prospero Burns), 16 (Age of Darkness - an anthology), 17 (The Outcast Dead), and 18 (Deliverence Lost)

8 - Know No Fear (Book 19)

I've read Know No Fear described as a dry book. I disagree. It's an essential book. Essential as a primary to Roboute Guilliman and the Ultramarines, critical for your enjoyment, and advisable because it's _extremely metal_. It captures a huge portion of what the warhammer universe in what feels like a few (416) short pages.

We're skipping ahead again, ignoring Books 20, 21, 22, and 23 to move to 

9 - Betrayer (Book 24)

The thing is, Aaron Dembski-Bowden only wrote 4 of the mainline Horus Heresy Novels, and I love every single one of them. If the deeply emotive and personal approach to the followers of chaos appealed to you in The First Heretic, you'll find that same flavour of character-driven misery and mania here. There are plenty of reasons why Betrayer is an important book for the plot, but I would commend it primarily for having some of the most memorable and gut wrenching moments in the series. 

With Betrayer read we're now free to investigate other plotlines again for a while.

### 6 - The Sack of Propsero Storyline

12) *Despite the fact that the next book on this list: Prospero Burns (Book 15) follows directly on from A Thousand Sons (Book 12), you don't need to read A Thousand Sons. There's important stuff in it, but mostly it's boring and a bit pretentious. You can read about the important bit - "Magnus's Folly" - on wh40kWiki and save the time*

53) *I feel like the writers got complacent in for the a couple of books around this time, technically Titandeath (Book 53) is really important but also I genuinely do not care. I don't like Titan combat so YMMV but I would read about this one on the wiki.*

51) *I still don't actually know what happens in Slaves to Darkness (Book 51), but I'm also not particularly compelled to find out. I've tried it twice and have been bored to tears within an hour of starting every time. I guess you could read about it on the wiki. You might learn something.*
