## The Ultimate Guide to the Horace Heresy
### Preface

The Horus Heresy starts with three/four books that occur mostly in sequence and are designed as an engaging, friendly jumping off point for the saga. Many will argue that once you've read those  you have should have a sufficient understanding of The Empire of Man and the seminal events of the Horus Heresy to enable you to explore HH in any order you like. That approach works well if you're already somewhat invested in the setting, like much of the intended audience of HH is. If you have favourite players and factions you can go and see what they're up to and follow leads into other storylines within the HH. For a beginner who isn't familiar with any of the major players in the setting I would recommend a more measured approach.

HH spawns from a single storyline, which cascades into 14 different storylines involving 23 major factions spanning approximately 3 decades. All of these stories and factions eventually converge to the final, inevitable events of Horus Heresy: Siege of Terra. You can imagine this structure as being shaped like a diamond. Starts at a point, ends at a point, but the vast bulk of the area is what happens between those two points. Many of these storylines are important to understanding the plot, some of them are good stories and are worth reading on their own, some of them are honestly just kind of boring. 

This document distils the 66 major HH novels into 39 books to be read in the order in which they're listed. If you read all of these, you will have a near comprehensive knowledge of all major plot points in the setting, while managing to avoid the lesser novels, anthologies, supplementary works in the series.

I have organised this bulk of work into a series of storylines. These are listed sequentially, as are the books within them.

Fortunately for new readers, HH does a good job of presenting four novels that you can read to back back to get shoved into the universe and familiar with how every other plotline begins. Three of these are a contiguous trilogy, and the fourth rounds out the storyline. 

Once you've completed this 'intro storyline' - **The Isstvan III Storyline** you can feel free to jump from storyline to storyline if a particular story arc isn't keeping your attention. I would still recommend completing them in order, however.

*Sometimes there are important books that I would still recommend you skip, why, and what you'll need to catch up on from other sources. I'll be leaving notes about such cases in Italics*



### 1 - The Isstvan III Storyline

1) **Horus Rising:** A very good book, EXCELLENT introduction to the setting

2) **False Gods:** A good book, which continues Horus Rising

3) **Galaxy in Flames:** An ok book, which continues False Gods

4) **Flight of the Eisenstein:** A good book, though a slow burn, which rounds out the opening chronology of HH



### 2 - The Isstvan V Dropsite Massacre Storyline

5) Fulgrim: Introduces Primarch Fulgrim, the Emperor's Children, and the insidious nature of Chaos

  *There are 5 short stories that cover this storyline but just read Fulgrim and you're good. You can always come back to them if you find yourself compelled to*



### 3 - Legion (Novel)

7) Legion: Introduces the Primarch(s) Alpharius, the Alpha Legion, John Grammaticus, the Cabal, and the Imperial Guard



### 4 - The Schism of Mars Storyline

9) Mechanicus: Introduces Mars, the Mechanicus, and techno-mythological nature of the Emperor and Imperium of Man

  *There are 6 short stories that cover this storyline, all are optional*



### 5 - The Battle of Phall Storyline

22) The Crimson Fist: Introduces Primarch Rogal Dorn, Primarch Perturabo, the Imperial Fists, and the Iron Warriors

  *There is 1 short story that covers this storyline, it's optional*



### 6 - The Sack of Propsero Storyline

12) *Despite the fact that the next book on this list: Prospero Burns (Book 15) follows directly on from A Thousand Sons (Book 12), you don't need to read A Thousand Sons. There's important stuff in it, but mostly it's boring and a bit pretentious. You can read about the important bit - "Magnus's Folly" - on wh40kWiki and save the time*

15) Prospero Burns: Introduces Primarch Leman Russ, the Space Wolves, the sacking of Prospero, and how Magnus gets Sort Of Murdered(tm)

28) Scars: Introduces Primarch Jaghatai Khan and the White Scars

36) The Path of Heaven: Concludes the storyline



### 7 - The Shadow Crusade Storyline

14) The First Heretic: Introduces Primarch Fulgrim, Primarch Roboute Guilliman, the Word Bearers, Erebus, and the Legio Custodes

19) Known No Fear: Continues the storyline

24) Betrayer: Continues the storyline

  *There are 2 major novels, an audio production, two novellas, and 13 short stories which take place within the Shadow Crusade Storyline. It's a cool storyline but none of them are mandatory*



### 8 - The Imperium Secundus Storyline

26) Vulkan Lives: Prerequisite to storyline

27) The Unremembered Empire: Starts the Storyline

34) Pharos: Continues the Storyline

46) Ruinstorm: Concludes the Storyline

  *There's a major novel I've excluded here: Angels of Caliban. Angels of Caliban and anything the Dark Angels touch becomes painfully, shockingly boring. Otherwise, this storyline includes 9 short stories and an audio production you can explore if you want*



### 9 - Meanwhile on Terra Storyline

39) Praetorian of Dorn: Prerequisite to storyline

41) Master of Mankind: Starts the storyline

  *At least 4 short stories are relevant to this storyline*



### 10 - Close on Terra Storyline

29) Vengeful Spirit: Starts the storyline

49) Wolfsbane: Continues the storyline

43) Deathfire: Continues the Storyline

53) *I feel like the writers got complacent in for the a couple of books around this time, technically Titandeath (Book 53) is really important but also I genuinely do not care. I don't like Titan combat so YMMV but I would read about this one on the wiki.*

51) *I still don't actually know what happens in Slaves to Darkness (Book 51), but I'm also not particularly compelled to find out. I've tried it twice and have been bored to tears within an hour of starting every time. I guess you could read about it on the wiki. You might learn something.*

47) Old Earth: Continues the Storyline

54) The Buried Dagger: Concludes the Storyline



### 11 - The Siege of Terra

55) The Solar War
  
56) The Lost and the Damned

58) The First Wall

59) Sons of the Selenar

60) Saturnine

61) The Fury of Magnus

62) Mortis

63) Warhawk

64) Echoes of Eternity

65) Garro: Knight of Grey

66) The End and the Death: Volume I

67) The End and the Death: Volume II

68) The End and the Death: Volume III
