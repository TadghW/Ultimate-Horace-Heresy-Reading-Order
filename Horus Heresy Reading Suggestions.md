## The Ultimate Horace Heracy Reading Order

### Preface

The Horus Heresy starts with a three book storyline designed as the jumping off point for the saga. They're essentially mandatory but also excellent reads. There's a fourth novel that follows these events directly and builds substantially on two major characters and a main faction. Reading all four of these in order is highly recommended.

From there the storyline cascades into 14 different storylines taking place over 27 years starring 23 major factions. It gets meaningfully complicated as each of the 66 novels and ??? novellas, eBooks and audio productions prelude to, refer to, and in many cases spoil one another. 

Topologically, aech of these plotlines resolve to the Siege of Terra. Imagine the structure of this saga as something like a diamond. Starts at a point, ends at a point, but greatest number of these co-occurring, interrelated plotlines are between those two points. 

Many of these storylines are major contributors key parts of the plot, some of them are minor contributors, some of them are worth reading for the sake of being excellent stories and fleshing out characters, factions, and the wider universe, and there's a decent argument to be made that some of them are better skipped. 

This document attempts to distil the 66 major novels into the more important 39 of the books and present them in a chronollogically correct and spoiler-free reading order. If you read all of these, you should have a near comprehensive knowledge of all the major plot points in the setting, while not having to push through the misses, lesser novels, anthologies, supplementary works in the series. I've organised this document into relatively distinct storylines. If multiple books are listed under one storyline, definitely read those in the order listed. If you have strong preferences on what and what not to read, by all means approach the storylines in your own order, but it is important to read the books that constitute a storyline in the correct order. 

This list is my suggestion of the order in which you should approach the saga. The number of the left is the order I suggest. The (Book Number) is the order in which they were released (which does not represent a suggested order from the black library, often the order of release is actually quite a poor order to follow)

Good luck. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do :)


### 1 - The Isstvan III Betrayal Storyline

1 - Horus Rising (Book 1) 

2 - False Gods (Book 2)

3 - Galaxy in Flames (Book 3)

4 - Flight of the Eisenstein (Book 4)

These four books are the essential introduction into the Horus Heresy, Istvan III is the location of all of its first acts and I would strongly recommend starting here.


### 2 - The Isstvan V Dropsite Massacre Storyline

5 - Fulgrim (Book 5)

Where Isstvan III is the first site of rebellion Isstvan V is where the galaxy is truly wrent assunder. It's an obvious follow on, but also introduces several important concepts and characters. 

### 3 - Legion (Single Novel)

6 - Legion (Book 7) 

Here's our first example of readnig the books in a different order than they were published. Immediately following Book 5, Fulgrim, in the release order was Book 6, Descent of Angels. The Dark Angels storyline genuinely bores me to tears. I hate their legion character and I have no interest in their history or how they're written. Most people I've spoken to strongly concur. We'll be skipping all novels in their storyline.

Legion on the other hand, is a good and interesting book that introduces the (mostly) genetically standard human military forces of the empire as well as various xenos species, an interesting space marine legion, and a very important main character.

### 4 - The Schism of Mars Storyline

6 - Mechanicum (Book 9)

Book 8, Battle for the Abyss, is ok. I found it kind of filler-y and I don't think it plays an important role in the plot. It's technically the first book in an important plotline later on, but even that plotline kind of disowns it and replaces it with more important and better books covering its prelude later on. 

The 6 books you've read so far have given a nice introduction to many of the most important factions in the universe but mostly neglected one of the most important. Considered a separate but equal organ from the empire's inception, the Mechanicum have titular control over most of the empire's manufactory hubs and pieces of high-technology. They're a key player often overlooked in the conflict and I think Mechanicum does a mostly good job of introducing and motivating them. 

I would have liked to have seen more Mechanicum in the series and I feel this book undersells them a little but it's an important and entertaining read and provides the cliffnotes early on.

### 5 - The Shadow Crusade Storyline

We're skipping Book 10 (Tales of Heresy - an anthology), Book 11 (Fallen Angels), Book 12 (A Thousand Sons) and Book 13 (Nemesis). We'll come back to the last two, but for now we'll move onto

7 - The First Heretic (Book 14)

Emperor forgive me, but I think the Horus Heresy itself is best understood when one has empathy for the insurgents and a grasp of the context in which they behave. The First Heretic charts the experiences of the word-bearers within the pre-heresy empire and explores their interactions with chaos. It's an essential read not only for an understanding of the forces of chaos and what drives man to embrace the warp, but also for the sake of the entire Shadow Crusade storyline which it preludes.

For the sake of keeping the Shadow Crusade storyline intact we are going to skip Books 15 (Prospero Burns), 16 (Age of Darkness - an anthology), 17 (The Outcast Dead), and 18 (Deliverence Lost)

8 - Know No Fear (Book 19)

I've read Know No Fear described as a dry book. I disagree. It's an essential book. Essential as a primary to Roboute Guilliman and the Ultramarines, critical for your enjoyment, and advisable because it's _extremely metal_. It captures a huge portion of what the warhammer universe in what feels like a few (416) short pages.

We're skipping ahead again, ignoring Books 20, 21, 22, and 23 to move to 

9 - Betrayer (Book 24)

The thing is, Aaron Dembski-Bowden only wrote 4 of the mainline Horus Heresy Novels, and I love every single one of them. If the deeply emotive and personal approach to the followers of chaos appealed to you in The First Heretic, you'll find that same flavour of character-driven misery and mania here. There are plenty of reasons why Betrayer is an important book for the plot, but I would commend it primarily for having some of the most memorable and gut wrenching moments in the series. 

With Betrayer read we're now free to investigate other plotlines again for a while.






### 5 - The Battle of Phall Storyline

22) The Crimson Fist: Introduces Primarch Rogal Dorn, Primarch Perturabo, the Imperial Fists, and the Iron Warriors


### 6 - The Sack of Propsero Storyline

12) *Despite the fact that the next book on this list: Prospero Burns (Book 15) follows directly on from A Thousand Sons (Book 12), you don't need to read A Thousand Sons. There's important stuff in it, but mostly it's boring and a bit pretentious. You can read about the important bit - "Magnus's Folly" - on wh40kWiki and save the time*

15) Prospero Burns: Introduces Primarch Leman Russ, the Space Wolves, the sacking of Prospero, and how Magnus gets Sort Of Murdered(tm)

36) The Path of Heaven: Concludes the storyline

### 10 - Close on Terra Storyline

29) Vengeful Spirit: Starts the storyline

49) Wolfsbane: Continues the storyline

43) Deathfire: Continues the Storyline

53) *I feel like the writers got complacent in for the a couple of books around this time, technically Titandeath (Book 53) is really important but also I genuinely do not care. I don't like Titan combat so YMMV but I would read about this one on the wiki.*

51) *I still don't actually know what happens in Slaves to Darkness (Book 51), but I'm also not particularly compelled to find out. I've tried it twice and have been bored to tears within an hour of starting every time. I guess you could read about it on the wiki. You might learn something.*
