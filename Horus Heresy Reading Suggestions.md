## The Ultimate Guide to the Horace Heresy
### Preface

The Horus Heresy starts with three/four books written in sequence and designed as an engaging, friendly jumping off point for the saga. Many will argue that once you've read those you have a sufficient understanding of The Empire of Man and the seminal events of the Horus Heresy to explore the HH novels in any order you see fit. That approach works well if you're already somewhat invested in the setting, like much of the intended audience of the HH is. If you have already favourite players and factions you can go and see what they're up to and follow leads from one storyline to another. For a beginner who isn't familiar with the setting I would recommend a more measured approach.

HH spawns from a single storyline, which cascades into 14 different storylines involving 23 major factions spanning approximately 3 decades. All of these stories and factions eventually converge to the final, inevitable events of Horus Heresy: Siege of Terra. You can imagine this structure as being shaped like a diamond. Starts at a point, ends at a point, but the vast bulk of the area is what happens between those two points. Many of these storylines are important to understanding the plot, some of them are good stories and are worth reading on their own, some of them are honestly just kind of boring. 

This document distils the 66 major HH novels into 39 books to be read in the order in which they're listed. If you read all of these, you will have a near comprehensive knowledge of all major plot points in the setting, while managing to avoid the lesser novels, anthologies, supplementary works in the series. I have organised this bulk of work into a series of storylines. These are listed sequentially, as are the books within them. Fortunately for new readers, HH does a good job of presenting four novels that you can read to back back to get shoved into the universe and familiar with how every other plotline begins. Three of these are a contiguous trilogy, and the fourth rounds out the storyline. Once you've completed this 'intro storyline' - **The Isstvan III Storyline** you can feel free to jump from storyline to storyline if a particular story arc isn't keeping your attention. I would still recommend completing these in order, however.



### 1 - The Isstvan III Storyline

1) **Horus Rising:** A very good book, EXCELLENT introduction to the setting

2) **False Gods:** A good book, which continues Horus Rising

3) **Galaxy in Flames:** An ok book, which continues False Gods

4) **Flight of the Eisenstein:** A good book, though a slow burn, which rounds out the opening chronology of HH



### 2 - The Isstvan V Dropsite Massacre Storyline

5) Fulgrim: Introduces Primarch Fulgrim, the Emperor's Children, and the insidious nature of Chaos



### 3 - Legion (Novel)

7) Legion: Introduces the Primarch(s) Alpharius, the Alpha Legion, John Grammaticus, the Cabal, and the Imperial Guard

### 6 - The Sack of Propsero Storyline

12) *Despite the fact that the next book on this list: Prospero Burns (Book 15) follows directly on from A Thousand Sons (Book 12), you don't need to read A Thousand Sons. There's important stuff in it, but mostly it's boring and a bit pretentious. You can read about the important bit - "Magnus's Folly" - on wh40kWiki and save the time*

15) Prospero Burns: Introduces Primarch Leman Russ, the Space Wolves, the sacking of Prospero, and how Magnus gets Sort Of Murdered(tm)

36) The Path of Heaven: Concludes the storyline

14) The First Heretic: Introduces Primarch Fulgrim, Primarch Roboute Guilliman, the Word Bearers, Erebus, and the Legio Custodes

19) Known No Fear: Continues the storyline

24) Betrayer: Continues the storyline



### 8 - The Imperium Secundus Storyline

26) Vulkan Lives: Prerequisite to storyline

27) The Unremembered Empire: Starts the Storyline

34) Pharos: Continues the Storyline

46) Ruinstorm: Concludes the Storyline



### 9 - Meanwhile on Terra Storyline

39) Praetorian of Dorn: Prerequisite to storyline

41) Master of Mankind: Starts the storyline



### 10 - Close on Terra Storyline

29) Vengeful Spirit: Starts the storyline

49) Wolfsbane: Continues the storyline

43) Deathfire: Continues the Storyline

53) *I feel like the writers got complacent in for the a couple of books around this time, technically Titandeath (Book 53) is really important but also I genuinely do not care. I don't like Titan combat so YMMV but I would read about this one on the wiki.*

51) *I still don't actually know what happens in Slaves to Darkness (Book 51), but I'm also not particularly compelled to find out. I've tried it twice and have been bored to tears within an hour of starting every time. I guess you could read about it on the wiki. You might learn something.*
